The forcing phenologies were built using the [8-day MODIS MOD15A2Hv6](https://modis.ornl.gov/data.html)
LAI product for all the data points in the MODIS release time period until
22-09-2018.

&nbsp;

Should you wish to update the LAI climatologies up to a more recent
date, you will first need the site level raw MODIS data, which you can retrieve
using `TractLSM/Utils/modis_lai_lat_lon.py`. You will then need to run
`TractLSM/Utils/met_flux_LAI_site_level.py` to regenerate the climatologies.
