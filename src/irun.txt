### The TractLSM can be used in several configurations, determined by a number
### of switches supplied to run the model. Therefore, this text file is a setup
### file equivalent to the namelist in LSMs.

# Throughout the file, 'None' or 'default' entries are the equivalent of
# commenting out the lines.
# When giving a file name, the absolute path is needed.


## 1. Site level runs

# The site can be set to match a meteorological forcings file for a specific
# site, e.g. 'Rocca'. Alternatively, 'None' calls a weather generator which uses
# idealised meteorological forcings to run the model.
# At a given site, the run year must also be specifed. If using the weather
# generator, the year must be set to 'None'.

site = None
year = None


# When running the model at site level, the actual switch can be set to 'no' to
# run a spinup (year -1). This spinup will be used to initialise the soil
# moisture state of the actual site and year run.
# If the switch is set to 'yes', then the given year with either the soil
# moisture initialisation from the spinup run (when it exists), or the
# parameterised saturation point, is run.

actual = yes


## 2. Specifications for the weather generator

# The weather generator should preferably be called upon when running an
# idealised experiment. Yet, a start day (e.g. doy = 1, i.e. Jan 1st) and a
# duration for the run (e.g. Nday = 1. runs for the start day only) have to be
# chosen. If the model is being run at site level, it does not matter what the
# doy and Ndays switches equate to.

doy = 1.
Ndays = 1.


## 3. Using a specific set of parameters

# Specific parameters should either be kept in a csv file (e.g. containing
# sites' info) or in a class within a python file (setup like the default
# parameters in TractLSM/Utils/).
# When importing the parameters from a python class, the import can differ
# depending on your machine. So you might have to modify the retrieve_class
# function in TractLSM/Utils/general_utils.py, which is not recommended.

params = default


## 4. Choosing the model configuration

# If you do not want to run the model for the full length of the timeseries
# (e.g. only running for the first 10 hours for testing purposes), you must
# specify the number of timesteps if must be run for. If no timestep number is
# specified, the full length of the timeseries is run.

Nsteps = default


# The models switch allows you to pick the C-H2O flux solver(s). If the switch
# is left unspecified (i.e. commented out or set to 'None'), the default
# configurations are run.
# These default choices are: 'Control, ProfitMax'.
# All possible choices are: 'Control, ProfitMax12, Wolf16'.
# Any single one of those configurations can be run alone.

models = default


# The Farquhar photosynthesis model is the default recommended photosynthesis
# model. The Collatz model can be run instead by chosing 'Collatz'.

photo = default


# The matricial optimisation solver runs at a relatively 'low' resolution, by
# default. When running the model on short timescales, it is worth exploring the
# effects of running at 'med' or 'high' resolutions.

resolution = default


# By default, the optimisation solver is called for every timestep provided in
# the forcing data. However, it can also be called to run for a given frequency.
# For example, a frequency of 3 will only call the optimisation solver every 3rd
# timestep in the forcing data.

fopt = default


# By default, the optimisation solver is allowed to search for the point of
# maximum profit on the full hydraulic stream. To speed up the optimisation, 
# restrictions can be applied to limit the portion of the stream on which to
# search for maximum profit. For example, a window of '20' binds the search in
# +/- 20% range relative to the previous maximum profit point.
# N.B.: one must be careful not to introduce solving artefacts in combining
# this option with the fopt option

window = default


# The tag refers to the unique name associated with the model configuration of
# the run. By default, this is based on the models that have been called upon, 
# such that the tag 'CP' refers to the Control + ProfitMax.
# However, any tag can be specified by the user.

tag = default


## 5. Generating default figures

# If plot is set to 'yes', several figures are generated, depending on the
# configuration of the run. These can be: a comparison of the different
# optimisation configurations, a comparison of the different optimisation
# configurations with the Control, or a comparison of the Farquhar and Collatz
# photosynthesis models.

plot = yes


## 6. Assigning the model run to a specific project

# When no project name is specified, all input and output files are stored
# directly in the input & output repositories. Otherwise, input and output files
# are stored in folders named after the project, e.g. input/var_kmax/ or
# output/var_kmax.

project = None
